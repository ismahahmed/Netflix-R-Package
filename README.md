# Netflix-R-Package

Repository for my semester long project for my Applied Data Science course. The objective of the project was to build a functional package in R. I found [netflix data](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) from kaggle and used it to do an exploratory data analysis on movie/tv show data available on Netflix.
